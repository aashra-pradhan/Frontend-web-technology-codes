<!-- block element and inline element--SIMPLE yet VVVIMP, html ma jati pani tag ki ta block ki ta 
    inline huncha, esko concept bina we can't maintain the position and we used layouts, we should know
kun tag chai block element ho, kun chai inline ani kati kati space lincha ti tags le........Eg. <p> le euta 
    single new line lincha, div le pani new line lincha....so these are block....Inline chai is, teslai jati 
space chahincha, tyati matra occupy garcha, tyo bhanda badhi gardaina....eg. bold,br, img, button, etc-->

<!-- ki block huncha ki inline huncha, afule chinnuparyo -->
<!-- this topic VIMP for exam as well -->
<!-- inline-block is HYBRID -->

    Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination 
    of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content.[1][2][3] Definitions
     of music vary depending on culture,[4] though it is an aspect of all human societies and a 
     cultural universal.[5]<span id="s6"> While scholars agree that music</span> is defined by a few specific elements,
      there is no consensus on their precise definitions.[6] The creation of music is commonly divided
       into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,[7] though the topic 
       itself extends into <span id=s7>academic</span> disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may
        be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.
In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance,
 in Hindustani classical<span id="s8">music</span>, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined 
 structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and
  responding while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure
   whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be
    unperformable or agglomerated electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and 
    private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performances, 
    and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game.
     Musical playback
 is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones.
