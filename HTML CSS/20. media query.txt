hamile asti meta ma viewport=by default rakhyam bhane every screen anusar content aaucha ni,
 that can be done by using coding as well. this method of displaying web content according to scrreen size(MOBILE, TAB, LAPTOP, even when 
 stretching the browser to small, large) is called responsive web page, that tool WE USE TO MAKE RESPONSIVE WEB PAGE is MEDIA QUERY. -->


 <!--Check sir ko code of -->positions and media query in classroom, also check the outputs for understanding, also an extra mile

 <!-- VIMP for EXAM as well, What is media query? -->
 EXAMPLE:
 @media (max-width: 600px){
	div.main{
		background-color: purple;
		color: white;
        align: left;
	}
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 800px){
	div.sidebar{
		display: none;
	}
	#logo1{
		float:left;
	}
}

esma, max-width=600 meaning, if a device having max scrreen width 800, tyo case ma div.main ko content lai css deko
width max 800 cha bhane logo centre ko satta left ma jancha and so on
only screen rakhyo bhane yo browser ma not applicable, only applicable for devices, so the same webpage can be made 
look different in browser and devices.

so this is how media query is basically used.


TALKING ABOUT SIR KO MEDIA QUERY KO FILES
What he's done is:-

container ma external css (certain screen size ko lai customize gareko css, eg. phone screen ko lai,,,so suppose bgcolor,
 size haru different rakhecham yo css ma)

container1 ma ni external css (certain screen size(suppose browser) ko lai customize gareko css)

container 2 ma external css has beeen used ACCORDINGLY, as per screen size, tei anusar
 we've taken the necessary css file(container ya container1) 
 
So media query can be used in  2 ways. One way as we did in container2 and one way we did in container3.

container 3 ma internal css nai use garera specify gardiyeko cha, media query lai.
