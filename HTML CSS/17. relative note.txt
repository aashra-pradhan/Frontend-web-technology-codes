    absolute le follow garne chai <non-static> i.e., browser, relative is also non-static 
        tesaile div1 lai relative rakhyo bhane, relative le static(div1) lai non-static banaidincha, ani the box(absolute) will follow div1
        if div1 lai kei position rakhenam bhane that's automatically static
        box lai absolute

    YOUTUBE HARRY:

    relative--> moves relative to its actual position in which it was initially(normal static(default) position) and leaves a gap in 
                its prior initial position
    absolute--> relative to the position of its 1st parent, leaves no gap in its initial position
