 schema is like ddt but schema is more powerful than ddt, 
ddt le xmldocument ko structurematra check garcha bhane, schema checks evth,values,
 datatype,etc. DDT cannot check datatype, values,,,DDT every page lai arkai
  chahincha but we can use the same schema for 
 multiple xml documents

 simple element is such an element in which just (root) element cha, 
 tesbhitra text cha, aru nothing, aru kei ni chaina 

complex elements chai esto elements which
 i. which are empty
 ii. which have attribute(attribute aaune bittikai complex element ho)
 (eslai text-only complex elements bhanincha)
 iii. which only have other elements within it(eslai elements-only complex elements bhanincha)
 iv. elements that contain both other elements and text

we treat simple and complex elements differently
