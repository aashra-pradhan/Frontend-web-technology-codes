            <td><p id="p1">My favorite place in the world is India. India is a home to diverse natives all across the nation. 
               From the north to the south, all we cn see is unity in diversity.Modern humans arrived on the Indian
             subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially
              in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second 
              only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
               margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley 
               Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an
                Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence 
                today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely
                 vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of
                  India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and 
                  exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, 
                  proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise
                   to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective 
                   era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status 
                   of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.
                    In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious 
                    cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

                In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became 
                established on India's southern and western coasts.Muslim armies from Central Asia 
                intermittently overran India's northern plains,eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, 
                and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. 
                    In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu 
                    culture in south India.In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised 
                    religion.The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,
                     leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. Gradually expanding rule of the British
                      East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also
                       consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised 
                       to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern 
                       ideas of education and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential 
                       nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became
                        the major factor in ending British rule.In 1947 the British Indian Empire wa
s partitioned into two independent dominions,a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority
nion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.

                India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system.
             It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361
              million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022. During the same time, its nominal per capita 
              income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From
               being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,India has become a fast-growing major
                economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.
                
                It has a space programme. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing 
                role in global culture.India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at
                 the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear-weapon state, which
                  ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours,
                   Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic 
                   challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels 
                   of air pollution.India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its 
                   forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally
                    been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,is supported among these forests, and
                     elsewhere, in protected habitats.
