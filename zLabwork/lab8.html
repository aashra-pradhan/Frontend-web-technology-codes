        <p align=justified>God is omnipresent, God is omnipotent, God is everywhere.In monotheistic thought, God is usually 
            viewed as the supreme being, creator, and principal object of faith. In non-monotheistic thought, 
            a god is "a spirit or being believed to control some part of the universe or life and often worshipped for doing so, or 
            something that represents this spirit or being".Belief in the existence of at least one god is called theism.

            Views regarding God vary considerably. Many notable theologians and philosophers have developed arguments for and 
            against the existence of God.Atheism rejects the belief in any deity. Agnosticism is the belief that the existence 
            of God is unknown or unknowable. Some theists view knowledge concerning God as derived from faith. God is often 
            conceived as the greatest entity in existence.
