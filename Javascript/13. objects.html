<!-- objects ko concept is VVVIMP in Js and its frameworks -->
<!-- evth that comes after . is object(eg.document.write()) or property(eg.document.cookie) eg.:window.alert, windw.prompt,,,esma alert, prompt are objects-->
<!-- An object has properties, all vehicles have similar properties, weight, height,
speeding capacity, so repeatedly chuttai chuuttai variables banaunu ko satta(for diff vehicles), WE CAN
 CREATE AN OBJECT,
AND USE THE SAME PROPERTIES EVERYWHERE, BUT JUS DIFFERENT values of the properties 
 for the same typeof things....This is the main use of OOPS-->
<!-- eg.of objects; person, vehicle, fruit,,,,all of theseindividually have same properties....all persons 
have name, address, home, age, etc. all fruits have color, taste, smell, etc. So this is the concept of OOPS. -->
